	// Copy constructor, copy assignment, destructor,   move constructor, move assignment
	// These functions are usually required only when a class is manually managing a dynamically allocated resource, and so all of them must be implemented to manage the resource safely.
	// see https://cpppatterns.com/patterns/rule-of-five.html
	// If a class uses only RAII resources (vector etc) the class itself will be RAII.

	// RAII types: Among others: map,memory(unique_ptr etc),vector,string.  Avoid manual memory management to improve safety and reduce bugs and memory leaks.

	// Rule of 0:
	// The rule of zero states that we can avoid writing any custom copy/move constructors, assignment operators, or destructors by using existing types that support the appropriate copy/move semantics.
	// The class foo above does not perform any manual memory management, yet correctly supports copies and moves without any memory leaks. The defaulted copy/move constructors and assignment operators will simply copy or move each member. For the int x (line 7), this will copy its value. For v (line 8), which is a std::vector, all of its elements will be copied over.
	// The class bar on lines 11â15 is not copyable by default because it has a std::unique_ptr member which itself is not copyable. However, it correctly supports move operations, which will transfer ownership of the dynamically allocated resource.

and: &&
and_eq: &=
bitand: &
or: ||
or_eq: |=
bitor: |
xor: ^
xor_eq: ^=
compl: ~
not: !
not_eq: !=


alignas (since C++11)		: exempel: struct alignas(8) S {};    Can be used on class/struct/enum and (most) variables. Specifies aligment requirement
alignof (since C++11)		: exempel alignof(Foo) or alignof(char).  Returns alignment requirements of type. If it has been manually set with alignas, then alignof returns this value
asm
atomic_cancel (TM TS)		: TMTS: transactional memory op(s), experimental feature. (Transactional memory is a concurrency synchronization mechanism combining groups of statements in transactions, using special HW if possible)
atomic_commit (TM TS)		: -|-
atomic_noexcept (TM TS)		: -|-
auto(1)
bool
break
case
catch
char
char16_t (since C++11)		: large enough to repr any UTF-16 code unit (what's the diff with wchar_t? Answer seems to be it's not reliable to use wchar_t because on Windows it's 16-bit and other systems it might be 32 bit)
char32_t (since C++11)		: large enough to repr any UTF-32 code unit 
class(1)
const
constexpr (since C++11)
const_cast					: add or remove const from variable. Highly unrecommended.
continue
decltype (since C++11)		: Inspects the declared type of an entity or the type and value category of an expression. Exempel: int i = 33; decltype(i) j = i * 2;   (Ã¤ven j blir hÃ¤r en int... antar detta kan vara anvÃ¤ndbart om man inte "vet" typen, t.ex en auto?). decltype is useful when declaring types that are difficult or impossible to declare using standard notation, like lambda-related types or types that depend on template parameters. 
default(1)					: switch default
delete(1)
do
double
dynamic_cast				: casta mellan klasser i en klass-hierarki, typiskt downcasta en klass till en *derived* class. (upcasta betyder dÃ¤remot att man castar frÃ¥n en derived till base, men fÃ¶r detta behÃ¶vs inte dynamic_cast, det Ã¤r ok Ã¤ndÃ¥).  Exempel: Base* b1 = new Base; if(Derived* d = dynamic_cast<Derived*>(b1)) { ... }
else
enum						: also, "enum class"
explicit					: Specifies that a constructor or conversion function (since C++11) or deduction guide (since C++17) is explicit, that is, it cannot be used for implicit conversions and copy-initialization. Simple example: class B {explicit B(int) { }}  Without explicit, C++ would allow writing e.g: B b = 1; since C++ would automatically call constructor B(int). But since we marked it explicit, this is not allowed by compiler. (The traditional wisdom is that constructors taking one parameter (explicitly or effectively through the use of default parameters) should be marked explicit). Prevent mistakenly doing a=b when we don't want that.
export(1)(3)				:unused and unreserved, up until C++20. Template thing.
extern(1)					:several diff uses. One is extern "C" in front of a function or several within {}, meaning they can be called from other modules written in C, since no name mangling for overloading occurs. Another is an extern unsigned char* g_video, which means we want to point to a global that was actually declared and defined in another file. Also several other uses.
false
float
for
friend						: an entire class can be a friend, or constructors/destructors, or a single method in another class, or for operator overloading such as <<. E.g.: friend std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& out, const Y& o);   friend char* X::foo(int);   friend X::X(char), X::~X();  // last is constr/destr friends
goto
if
inline(1)					:inline is a suggestion, not guaranteed. For small mthods it should usually happen though. A method/func completely defined in a header is implicit inline. Same is true for constexpr method/func
int
long
mutable(1)					:suggests that part of something that is const, is NOT const. Example: const struct { int n1; mutable int n2; } x = {0, 0};  x.n1=4; //error, x struct is const.  x.n2=4; // ok, n2 is mutable 
namespace
new
noexcept (since C++11)		: a method/func marked noexcept promises not to throw any (unhandled) exceptions. If it still DOES throw an exception, that seems to lead to an immediate termination. Examples: void f() noexcept; // the function f() does not throw     void (*fp)() noexcept(false); // fp points to a function that may throw       void g(void pfa() noexcept);  // g takes a pointer to function that doesn't throw
nullptr (since C++11)
operator
private
protected
public
reflexpr (reflection TS)	: experimental, no explanation/use yet. For reflection, obviously.
register(2)					: unused/reserved since C++17
reinterpret_cast			: a stronger cast than static_cast, since it can e.g. cast from one pointer type to another. Use with care. Cannot cast on/off const or volatile.
return
short
signed
sizeof(1)
static						: inside class=not part of class instance, inside function=keeps its value, initializes once, as part of function declaration=cannot be accessed/linked to from outside its own source file
static_assert (since C++11)	: Performs compile-time assertion checking. Useful for e.g. templates, example: template <class T> struct myS { static_assert(std::is_default_constructible<T>::value, "Dude, we won't allow that");};  struct no_default { no_default () = delete; };   data_structure<int> ds_ok;   myS<no_default> ds_error; // compile error here since we removed default constructor of no_default struct.    Note: there are heaps of type checkers like std::is_default_constructible<T>::value
static_cast					: the least powerful casting in C++, e.g. no cast between pointer types. Use whenever possible
struct(1)					: the only difference between a struct and a class in C++ is struct has default public accessability whereas class has private
switch
synchronized (TM TS)		: TMTS, see atomic_cancel above
template
this
thread_local (since C++11)	: put in front of an either global or func static variable to mean that each thread has its own copy of the variable, so it is safe to modify it (but the value can't be shared then of course) 
throw
true
try
typedef
typeid						: Queries information of a type. Used where the dynamic type of a polymorphic object must be known and for static type identification. E.g: int myint=50; cout << "Type: " << typeid(myint).name();
typename
union
unsigned
using(1)					: Many uses, like: using namespace std; (to include whole namespace), or using namespace std::chrono; (to only include Chrono), or using std::vector to specifically allow using vector keyword without std.  Or using namespace MyShit.  Or as an alias, a more C++ typedef, e.g: using UPtrMapSS = std::unique_ptr<std::unordered_map<std::string, std::string>>;  now can use UPtrMapSS instead of long name.
virtual						: A virtual method can be overriden. A virtual =0 method is "pure virtual" and creates an abstract class. If you inherit a class with the virtual keyword (instead of just private or public), it means that "grandchildren will not inherit twice"... umm.. basically a way to fix multiple inheritance issues. If both B and C derives from A, and then we make D inherit from BOTH B and C, then it will have two instances of A, including all its variables, methods etc, which is a mess to use cause you need to specify if it's B::A or C::A you use. But if B and C inherits virtual from A, then this problem goes away cause D only gets single A instance  
void
volatile					: a variable marked volatile says to compiler "do not optimize away this variable ever". A volatile is NOT thread safe by itself, use locks
wchar_t						: same as char16_t on Windows, but same as char32_t on other systems... Conclusion is to probably avoid this, unless coding for single platform only.
while

In addition to keywords, there are identifiers with special meaning, which may be used as names of objects or functions, but have special meaning in certain contexts.

final (C++11)				: put in after class/struct to make it impossible to derive from, e.g. struct A final {},  or struct B final : A {} to inherit but allow no further subclasses. Also, an implementation of an overriden method can be marked final to allow no further overrides, e.g. "void foo() final;" assuming we are overriding "virtual void foo();" in base class.  

override (C++11)			: you don't have to write this to override a virtual method in C++, BUT it makes the interface clearer, AND perhaps more importantly compiler will warn if base class method is NOT virtual (to avoid hiding). Also helps if we accidentally put e.g const somewhere on our overriding method which was not on base class, compiler will then complain it is NOT the same and we are NOT overriding.

transaction_safe (TM TS)	: TMTS, see atomic_cancel above
transaction_safe_dynamic (TM TS)

    (1) - meaning changed or new meaning added in C++11.
    (2) - meaning changed in C++17.
    (3) - meaning changed in C++20. 

Note that and, bitor, or, xor, compl, bitand, and_eq, or_eq, xor_eq, not, and not_eq (along with the digraphs <%, %>, <:, :>, %:, and %:%:) provide an alternative way to represent standard tokens.

Also, all identifiers that contain a double underscore __ in any position and each identifier that begins with an underscore followed by an uppercase letter is always reserved and all identifiers that begin with an underscore are reserved for use as names in the global namespace.

/*

Scoped_lock  vs  unique_lock:
-----------------------------

The two objects are for different purposes. scoped_lock is for the simple case of wanting to lock some number of mutex objects in a deadlock-free way. Locking a single mutex is just a special case of locking multiple ones. The object is completely immobile, and it's very simple.

unique_lock provides a number of features, few of which are especially applicable when simultaneously locking multiple mutexes.

    Deferred locking. Deferring would have to be all or nothing; you either defer locking all the mutexes or none of them. It's not clear why you would want to defer locking a series of mutexes, since you would have to relinquish any locks that succeeded if any of them failed.

    Timeout locks. If you want a timeout of 100ms, does that mean that locking all of the mutexes should take no more than 100ms? That is, if the first 3 lock immediately, but the next one takes 75ms, should it be considered a timeout if the fifth takes 30ms?

    Adoption of mutexes. The whole point of locking multiple mutexes in a single operation is to be able to avoid deadlocks. This is done by locking the mutexes in an order that is globally consistent. That is, any place where you lock those mutex objects with std::lock equivalent calls will lock them in the same order, no matter what.

    If one of the mutexes has already been locked (and thus the lock should be adopted), then it was locked outside of std::lock, and thus you have no guarantee that it was locked in the globally consistent order. And that ignores the difficulty of specifying which mutexes to adopt and which ones to lock.

    Transfer of ownership (being moveable). This is a dubious prospect for multiple mutexes for similar reasons as adopting locks. The guarantees against deadlocks only work if a single call to std::lock or equivalent locks all of the mutexes of interest. If you're moving ownership of these scoped_locks around, it becomes very easy to be at a point in code where you have multiple scoped_locks in the same scope, when you could have locked all of them in one go. This courts the very kind of deadlock that std::lock was created to avoid.

Note that std::lock (the basis of scoped_lock's functionality) doesn't even try to provide any of these features.

Could there be a specialization of scoped_lock which took only one mutex type that offered the behavior of unique_lock? Sure. But that would violate the purpose of scoped_lock, which was to be a deadlock-safe locker for multiple mutexes. It only obsoleted lock_guard by accident, since it had the identical interface in the case of a single mutex.

Besides, having template specializations with vastly different interfaces and capabilities doesn't usually work out well. See vector<bool> as an example.

/*
Optimization attempts, C++:

(0. Profile!)
1. Change to a better algorithm
2. Compiler flags (like -O3 in g++ can make huge difference)
3. Use inline(__forceinline) / const
4. Use constexpr
5. <execution> parallell algorithms in C++ 17+  AND/OR...
6. ...Use threads(thread pool) / async
7. Move semantics/&&
8. Move algorithm to GPU? (experimental)
9. Use TMP (Template Meta Programming)? (superseded by constexpr??)
10. Data locality (used a lot in gaming). Avoid pointers/references, pack (value) data tightly in structs to minimize cache misses (that can be very costly)
(11). Read/write less data (smaller data types). Might not always give result.
(12) Reduce amount of copying/converting/casting between types
(13) Decrease amount of function calls (manually rather not, use inline)

Stuff not to do:
* Oldschool stuff like replacing *16 with <<4, or manually unrolling loops. Compiler with -O3 will do these automatically, and more... Also, asm, unless very very desperate...

/* TMP vs constexpr:

TMP should reuse instantiation whereas constexpr function might recompute it each time. In that case TMP will compile faster.

And why not replace TMP with constexpr if it is better?
---------------------------------------------------------
First, we won't drop TMP which is used, for retro-compatibility.

Then, TMP is generally more adapted to return type or several types.

template <typename T> struct add_pointer
{
    using type = T*;
};

using int_ptr = add_pointer<int>::type;

whereas constexpr would require decltype and/or std::declval

template <typename T> struct Tag { using type = T; };
constexpr Tag<T*> add_pointer(Tag<T>) {return {}; }

using int_ptr = decltype(add_pointer(Tag<int>{})::type;

/*
C++ keywords
==============
This is a list of reserved keywords in C++. Since they are used by the language, these keywords are not available for re-definition or overloading.
https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/keyword

Alternative for standard tokens:
and: &&
and_eq: &=
bitand: &
or: ||
or_eq: |=
bitor: |
xor: ^
xor_eq: ^=
compl: ~
not: !
not_eq: !=


alignas (since C++11)		: exempel: struct alignas(8) S {};    Can be used on class/struct/enum and (most) variables. Specifies aligment requirement
alignof (since C++11)		: exempel alignof(Foo) or alignof(char).  Returns alignment requirements of type. If it has been manually set with alignas, then alignof returns this value
asm
atomic_cancel (TM TS)		: TMTS: transactional memory op(s), experimental feature. (Transactional memory is a concurrency synchronization mechanism combining groups of statements in transactions, using special HW if possible)
atomic_commit (TM TS)		: -|-
atomic_noexcept (TM TS)		: -|-
auto(1)
bool
break
case
catch
char
char16_t (since C++11)		: large enough to repr any UTF-16 code unit (what's the diff with wchar_t? Answer seems to be it's not reliable to use wchar_t because on Windows it's 16-bit and other systems it might be 32 bit)
char32_t (since C++11)		: large enough to repr any UTF-32 code unit 
class(1)
const
constexpr (since C++11)
const_cast					: add or remove const from variable. Highly unrecommended.
continue
decltype (since C++11)		: Inspects the declared type of an entity or the type and value category of an expression. Exempel: int i = 33; decltype(i) j = i * 2;   (Ã¤ven j blir hÃ¤r en int... antar detta kan vara anvÃ¤ndbart om man inte "vet" typen, t.ex en auto?). decltype is useful when declaring types that are difficult or impossible to declare using standard notation, like lambda-related types or types that depend on template parameters. 
default(1)					: switch default
delete(1)
do
double
dynamic_cast				: casta mellan klasser i en klass-hierarki, typiskt downcasta en klass till en *derived* class. (upcasta betyder dÃ¤remot att man castar frÃ¥n en derived till base, men fÃ¶r detta behÃ¶vs inte dynamic_cast, det Ã¤r ok Ã¤ndÃ¥).  Exempel: Base* b1 = new Base; if(Derived* d = dynamic_cast<Derived*>(b1)) { ... }
else
enum						: also, "enum class"
explicit					: Specifies that a constructor or conversion function (since C++11) or deduction guide (since C++17) is explicit, that is, it cannot be used for implicit conversions and copy-initialization. Simple example: class B {explicit B(int) { }}  Without explicit, C++ would allow writing e.g: B b = 1; since C++ would automatically call constructor B(int). But since we marked it explicit, this is not allowed by compiler. (The traditional wisdom is that constructors taking one parameter (explicitly or effectively through the use of default parameters) should be marked explicit). Prevent mistakenly doing a=b when we don't want that.
export(1)(3)				:unused and unreserved, up until C++20. Template thing.
extern(1)					:several diff uses. One is extern "C" in front of a function or several within {}, meaning they can be called from other modules written in C, since no name mangling for overloading occurs. Another is an extern unsigned char* g_video, which means we want to point to a global that was actually declared and defined in another file. Also several other uses.
false
float
for
friend						: an entire class can be a friend, or constructors/destructors, or a single method in another class, or for operator overloading such as <<. E.g.: friend std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& out, const Y& o);   friend char* X::foo(int);   friend X::X(char), X::~X();  // last is constr/destr friends
goto
if
inline(1)					:inline is a suggestion, not guaranteed. For small mthods it should usually happen though. A method/func completely defined in a header is implicit inline. Same is true for constexpr method/func
int
long
mutable(1)					:suggests that part of something that is const, is NOT const. Example: const struct { int n1; mutable int n2; } x = {0, 0};  x.n1=4; //error, x struct is const.  x.n2=4; // ok, n2 is mutable 
namespace
new
noexcept (since C++11)		: a method/func marked noexcept promises not to throw any (unhandled) exceptions. If it still DOES throw an exception, that seems to lead to an immediate termination. Examples: void f() noexcept; // the function f() does not throw     void (*fp)() noexcept(false); // fp points to a function that may throw       void g(void pfa() noexcept);  // g takes a pointer to function that doesn't throw
nullptr (since C++11)
operator
private
protected
public
reflexpr (reflection TS)	: experimental, no explanation/use yet. For reflection, obviously.
register(2)					: unused/reserved since C++17
reinterpret_cast			: a stronger cast than static_cast, since it can e.g. cast from one pointer type to another. Use with care. Cannot cast on/off const or volatile.
return
short
signed
sizeof(1)
static						: inside class=not part of class instance, inside function=keeps its value, initializes once, as part of function declaration=cannot be accessed/linked to from outside its own source file
static_assert (since C++11)	: Performs compile-time assertion checking. Useful for e.g. templates, example: template <class T> struct myS { static_assert(std::is_default_constructible<T>::value, "Dude, we won't allow that");};  struct no_default { no_default () = delete; };   data_structure<int> ds_ok;   myS<no_default> ds_error; // compile error here since we removed default constructor of no_default struct.    Note: there are heaps of type checkers like std::is_default_constructible<T>::value
static_cast					: the least powerful casting in C++, e.g. no cast between pointer types. Use whenever possible
struct(1)					: the only difference between a struct and a class in C++ is struct has default public accessability whereas class has private
switch
synchronized (TM TS)		: TMTS, see atomic_cancel above
template
this
thread_local (since C++11)	: put in front of an either global or func static variable to mean that each thread has its own copy of the variable, so it is safe to modify it (but the value can't be shared then of course) 
throw
true
try
typedef
typeid						: Queries information of a type. Used where the dynamic type of a polymorphic object must be known and for static type identification. E.g: int myint=50; cout << "Type: " << typeid(myint).name();
typename
union
unsigned
using(1)					: Many uses, like: using namespace std; (to include whole namespace), or using namespace std::chrono; (to only include Chrono), or using std::vector to specifically allow using vector keyword without std.  Or using namespace MyShit.  Or as an alias, a more C++ typedef, e.g: using UPtrMapSS = std::unique_ptr<std::unordered_map<std::string, std::string>>;  now can use UPtrMapSS instead of long name.
virtual						: A virtual method can be overriden. A virtual =0 method is "pure virtual" and creates an abstract class. If you inherit a class with the virtual keyword (instead of just private or public), it means that "grandchildren will not inherit twice"... umm.. basically a way to fix multiple inheritance issues. If both B and C derives from A, and then we make D inherit from BOTH B and C, then it will have two instances of A, including all its variables, methods etc, which is a mess to use cause you need to specify if it's B::A or C::A you use. But if B and C inherits virtual from A, then this problem goes away cause D only gets single A instance  
void
volatile					: a variable marked volatile says to compiler "do not optimize away this variable ever". A volatile is NOT thread safe by itself, use locks
wchar_t						: same as char16_t on Windows, but same as char32_t on other systems... Conclusion is to probably avoid this, unless coding for single platform only.
while

In addition to keywords, there are identifiers with special meaning, which may be used as names of objects or functions, but have special meaning in certain contexts.

final (C++11)				: put in after class/struct to make it impossible to derive from, e.g. struct A final {},  or struct B final : A {} to inherit but allow no further subclasses. Also, an implementation of an overriden method can be marked final to allow no further overrides, e.g. "void foo() final;" assuming we are overriding "virtual void foo();" in base class.  

override (C++11)			: you don't have to write this to override a virtual method in C++, BUT it makes the interface clearer, AND perhaps more importantly compiler will warn if base class method is NOT virtual (to avoid hiding). Also helps if we accidentally put e.g const somewhere on our overriding method which was not on base class, compiler will then complain it is NOT the same and we are NOT overriding.

transaction_safe (TM TS)	: TMTS, see atomic_cancel above
transaction_safe_dynamic (TM TS)

    (1) - meaning changed or new meaning added in C++11.
    (2) - meaning changed in C++17.
    (3) - meaning changed in C++20. 

Note that and, bitor, or, xor, compl, bitand, and_eq, or_eq, xor_eq, not, and not_eq (along with the digraphs <%, %>, <:, :>, %:, and %:%:) provide an alternative way to represent standard tokens.

Also, all identifiers that contain a double underscore __ in any position and each identifier that begins with an underscore followed by an uppercase letter is always reserved and all identifiers that begin with an underscore are reserved for use as names in the global namespace. See identifiers for more details.
